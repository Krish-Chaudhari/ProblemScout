# 🌲 Cypress - Toronto Street Issue Reporting System

## Overview

Cypress is a civic engagement platform designed to help citizens of Toronto report, track, and stay updated on public issues such as potholes, broken streetlights, vandalism, or garbage accumulation. The system replaces the manual, fragmented reporting process with a unified, intuitive, and transparent solution.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Currently, reporting street problems in Toronto is tedious and inefficient:
- Citizens must find and call the correct city department.
- There’s no centralized way to track issue resolution.
- Duplicate and false reports are common and unfiltered.

## ✅ Cypress Goals

Cypress aims to streamline this process by offering:
- 📍 **Map-based issue reporting**: Pinpoint issues with high geographic accuracy.
- 🛠️ **Categorized problem reporting**: Select from predefined issue types for clarity.
- 🔔 **Notification subscriptions**: Stay informed about the resolution process.
- 🗺️ **Public issue visibility**: View nearby reported issues on a map.
- 🔁 **Duplicate detection**: Flag redundant reports within a defined perimeter.
- 🚫 **False report prevention**: Mitigation strategies for spam/fraud.

## 🧩 Features

- Interactive map for pinpointing issues.
- Form-based reporting with custom and predefined categories.
- User subscriptions to get updates on reported problems.
- Admin panel to manage and resolve reports (stubbed or real backend).
- Duplicate detection using proximity thresholds.
- CAPTCHA and login systems to minimize spam (in progress or planned).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Suggested)

- **Frontend**: React.js / Vue.js / HTML5 + JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js / Django / Flask (with stubbed database or mock API)
- **Database**: MongoDB / PostgreSQL / Firebase (stub or local)
- **Map API**: Google Maps API / Leaflet.js / Mapbox
